# Gradio

> Gradio is an open-source Python package that allows you to quickly build a demo or web application for your machine learning model, API, or any arbitrary Python function. You can then share a link to your demo or web application in just a few seconds using Gradio's built-in sharing features. No JavaScript, CSS, or web hosting experience needed!. Follow the instructions below to get started. 


## Quickstart

Start by creating a virtual environment in your project directory:

```bash
python -m venv .env
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source .env/bin/activate
```

You can install gradio using this command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade gradio
```

- You can run Gradio in your favorite code editor, Jupyter notebook, Google Colab, or anywhere else you write Python.

```python
import gradio as gr

def greet(name, intensity):
    return "Hello, " + name + "!" * int(intensity)

demo = gr.Interface(
    fn=greet,
    inputs=["text", "slider"],
    outputs=["text"],
)

demo.launch()
```

- Gradio allows to easily share a demo without having to worry about the hassle of hosting on a web server. Simply set share=True in launch(), and a publicly accessible URL will be created for your demo. Let's revisit our example demo, but change the last line as follows:

```python
import gradio as gr

def greet(name):
    return "Hello " + name + "!"

demo = gr.Interface(fn=greet, inputs="textbox", outputs="textbox")
    
demo.launch(share=True)  # Share your demo with just 1 extra parameter ðŸš€
```
This will generate a public URL like [this](https://a23dsf231adb.gradio.live)
